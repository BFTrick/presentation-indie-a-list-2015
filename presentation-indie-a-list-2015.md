## How Hard Is It
## to Buy a Bicycle?

![](assets/images/bicycle.jpg)

^ My partner and I moved to Denver Colorado just 6 months ago. And Denver is a city where everyone rides their bikes. She has to use her car for work but other than work we maybe use the car once a week. We bike or walk everywhere else. It's a lifestyle choice that we really like.

^ You can imagine how important it is to have a nice bike when you use it so often. She had her bike since high school and needless to say she needed an upgrade.

^ So what do you do when you don't know anything about something? You reach out to an expert.

^ So she reached out to a friend of hers that own's a dozen bikes and is planning a month long bike trip going from Spain to Morocco.

^ She decides to meet with her expert friend and that very day she comes back with a new bike. An excellent bike her friend tells her.

^ When she tries it out she realizes that her feet don't fit on the peddles. The peddles have covers on them (known as cages). You have to slide you feet in them you can't just place your feet on them.

^ She can't sit on the seat. She has to lean all the way forward.

^ When she got going on the bike she realized there weren't any gears. Well technically there were. They're called Downtube shifters. And these downtube shifters are just beneath the handle bars and they look like two small levers that you have to manually adjust. They don't just click into place.

## There is no such thing as **a perfect solution**.

^ I don't care if you're talking about e-commerce, bicycles, or a cup of coffee. There is no such thing as perfect.

^ If someone tries to sell you something without first asking you your needs they don't have you interests at heart.

^ So let's talk about your needs
